AirCast: Chromecast ANE for Adobe AIR
=====================================

iOS
---

Support for iOS is largely complete, but following an upgrade to the latest Google Cast SDK and addition of amd64 support, the following issues have appeared:

* Intermittent _"Invalid data from [Chromecast name], ignoring"_ error during initial scan
* Intermittent connection issues (sometimes, it just won't connect!) 

Can you help?

Android

Coming soon... ish ;-)
